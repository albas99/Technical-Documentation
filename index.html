          It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new
          to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build
          another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to get your own simple
          website online, so we'll start there.
        </p>
        <p>
          By working through the articles listed below in order, you will go
          from nothing to getting your first webpage online. Let's begin our
          journey!

          You don't need any previous knowledge to start this course. All you
          need is a computer that can run modern web browsers, an internet
          connection, and a willingness to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not sure if front-end web development is for you, and/or
          you want a gentle introduction before starting a longer and more
          complete course, work through our Getting started with the web module
          first.

          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure
          your web content and give it meaning and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet
          points? Do I have images inserted on my page? Do I have a data table?
          Without overwhelming you, HTML basics provides enough information to
          make you familiar with HTML.
        </p>
        <p>Example of HTML</p>
        <pre>
                <code>
                   <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;&sol;strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;&sol;p&gt;</p>
                </code>
            </pre>
        <p>
          Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your
          website. For example, do you want the text to be black or red? Where
          should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and
          colors should be used to decorate your website? CSS basics takes you
          through what you need to get started.

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
       <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>
    <li><p>JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p></li></ul>
    <p>Below are some JavaScript examples</p>
    <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");
    </code>
    <br></br>
    <code>
        var x = 42.
    </code>
    <br></br>
    <code>
        let y = 13.
    </code>

        <p>Once you have finished writing the code and organizing the files that make up your website, you need to put it all online so people can find it. Publishing your sample code describes how to get your simple sample code online with minimum effort.</p>
